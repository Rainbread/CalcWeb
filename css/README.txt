css folder is where we put all the css related file:
1) Stylesheet (You can also put in calcweb.html if you want, but it will be a mess).
1.1) Font or text size / color / family
1.2) Background color
1.3) Border / Padding
Please make sure the path are correct when import to calcweb.html! (e.g. css/EXAMPLE.css)
